- The fare for a subway or local bus ride is $2.75.
- Initial MetroCard purchase can be from $5.50 to $80 
	+ $1 for new card
- Put $5.50 or more on your card and receive an 11 percent bonus. 
	For example, a $20 purchase gives you $22.20 on your card. 
	Refill your card to use the balance.
- Given current MC value, how much s/b added to have value come out divisible by 2.75?
